I enrolled for a web design course offered by [Vako Shvili](https://www.vakoshvili.com/) that helped me learn about graphic design concepts like layout, typography, visual hierarchy, the art of color, how to use photos and many more.

## Key concepts about UI/UX design I learned

### Layout is king

<u>Alignment</u>: Just a simple alignment can make something look designed. On the other hand, misalignment will make it look sloppy, and amateur work.

<u>Visual hierarchy</u>: Visual hierarchy is helping the audience to digest the information easily. We can only focus on one thing at a time. When everything is of equal importance we don't know where to look at. We get dazed by the chas of the information. But good design guides the audience.

Establishing a hierarchy is quite simple. Bigger is more visible hence higher in the hierarcy. Smaller and less visible elements will be lower in the hierarchy.

<u>Proximity</u>: Good design likes grouping elements closer to each other if they have something in common. This is a design concept called Proximity.

The basic idea of proximity is that:

1. Things that are related, should be close together.
2. And things that are NOT related, should be further apart.

### Typography

<u>Personality</u>: Each typeface has a personality. Some are fun and playful, some are strict and blunt, and some feel academic and fancy. The personality of a typeface is as important as choosing the right outfit for the right occasion.

<u>Letter Spacing</u>: Letter spacing is one of the properties that we are able to change in fonts on the web. We can set letter very tight and snug or very wide and airy like these guys here. With a very wide letter spacing desgners create an effect called Panorama.

<u>Line Height</u>: Line height is the spacing between the lines of text. If the lines are too close to each other, reading text might become difficult.

<u>TIP</u>: In most cases, for the body text, 140% (1.4 x font-size) is an excellent line height. Don't go over 180% unless you know what you're doing.

### The art of color

<u>Sampling colors</u>: Sampling colors from the real world, will almost always give you great results.

<u>TIP</u>: When sampling colors, bluring the image to average out the colors is a very efficient technique.

<u>Fine-tuning colors</u>: Ability to fine-tune a color is a really handy skill that will let one nail the designs. We can do this by changing the color saturation and brightness, either by editing HSB fields or just dragging the indicator on the color map.

## Some useful design tricks

<u>Contrast</u>: Contrast can be expressed in the composition in three main ways:

- Contrast in <u>weight</u>. Coupling light and heavy objects.
- Contrast in <u>size</u>. Putting very large and very small next to each other.
- Contrast in <u>color</u>. Matching contrasting and complementary colors like black and white, red and white, etc.

<u>Whitespace</u>: White space is this empty space around elements. White space draws attention to the object. It's not just easier to see the object, but it becomes much more interesting and important.

<u>Repetition</u>: Repetition is a popular design trick. It's when you take one item that might not be interesting on its own but repeat it several times andnow we have something that's more interesting.

<u>Overlapping</u>: The trick is to take different elements and overlap them. Do you see how the hand of the statue is overallping National Geographic title and also the yellow frame? It makes the design more interesting and adds an extra dimension to the composition.

It ties two otherwise disconnected elements, together. And it also creates drama in the design.

<u>Tension</u>: Visual tension in design can make a work very interesting to look at. Tension in design can be created by:

- tilting elements and using angles, to create a sense of movement
- placing objects on the edge
- moving elements out of balance
- hiding parts of the object (extreme cropping is tension trick too)
- overlapping elements

<u>Consistency</u>: Inconsistent design is very easy to tell. Consistency isn't really a trick but more like a core principle of design.

Inconsistency in photo styles can be created by things like:

- using isolated (unboxed) images with regular boxed images
- different zoom levels next to each other
- very different emotions of the models in the photos
- noticeable differences in photo filters

## Resources:

Following the above patterns and tricks I successfully launched a couple of responsive web pages to practice my design skills on the web. I worked my way from project briefing, to creating moodboards, wireframes, design and eventually created functional websites.

- [Chat](https://chat-app-homepage.webflow.io/) - Homepage design concept built for a chat application. The design mockups and high fidelity wireframes were built in Figma and later moved on to build the responsive web page on Webflow.
- [Team](https://team-app-5efacf.webflow.io/) - Website design concept for remote team collaboration. It includes a minimal and powerful blog. Built the website in Webflow, one of the best CMS for blog hosting. Want to collaborate with your team remotely?
- [Stopify](https://boro-ui-ux.webflow.io/project/stopify-ecommerce) - Powerful Ecommerce Mobile UI Kit with clean and elegant design. The prototype and micro-interactions are built using Figma. Stopify is the one-stop spot for electronic essentials. Designed to kickstart your e-commerce almost instantly.
